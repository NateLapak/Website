        <p>
          I will be starting my 2nd year at the University of Alberta next week.
          I will be taking Statistics, Math and Comp Sci courses to further my
          interest in the AI, ML and other fields. Over the summer, I managed to
          land a contract job for Revolution Cycle. I worked on their new
          website using Svelte, SvelteKit, PostgreSQL, and Figma for web
          designing. I learned a lot about collaborating with others in web
          development and about the software development process. Hopefully,
          this will help me find a new internship for next year!
