# About project
This project was created after having already done multiple other web developper projects. I wanted to create a website that would showcase my programming, my projects and my computer science abilities when applying for an internship or a job. This project is built entirely by me and serves to demonstrate my programming and web development abilties.

# Built With

This section contains all the major frameworks or libraries I used in this project. 

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
* [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
 
# Purpose
I've always wanted to create a personal website from scratch without having to follow any other tutorial. I had previously tried to create a personal website but I lacked the experience in making projects to finish it. So in CTS 30, I decided that now is the time I would be able to create a personal website. As stated before, I wanted to demonstrate my projects and programming abilities to job recruiters to showcase that I am capable and qualified.
